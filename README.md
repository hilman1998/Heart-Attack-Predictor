# Heart Attack Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the likelihood of patients having a heart attack based on their demographic and healthcare data. The goal is to identify high-risk individuals so that preventative measures can be taken early. This analysis is performed using a logistic regression model in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Features
- **Data Preparation**: Thorough preprocessing of demographic and healthcare data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using logistic regression to forecast the risk of heart attacks.
- **Model Validation**: Implementing various metrics to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the model. These include a classification matrix.
- **Visualization**: Generating intuitive visualizations to present the data insights including which factors correlate the most to heart attacks.
- **Risk Assessment**: Providing risk profiles to aid in preventative healthcare planning.

## Key Skills Utilized
- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the data is clean and appropriate for analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying logistic regression for predictive modeling.
- **Statistical Methods**: Utilizing statistics to interpret model outputs and validate assumptions.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating compelling visualizations to showcase findings and insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Employing Jupyter Notebook for an organized, interactive coding environment.
